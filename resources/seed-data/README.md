Census data from the Office of National Statistics, National Records for Scotland and Northern Ireland Statistics and Research Agency have been downloaded as CSV/Excel files.
Land Cover Map 2021 raster data has been obtained from UKCEH.
Output Area (/Data Zone) geography data (Extent of the Realm), were obtained for England & Wales, Northern Ireland, and Scotland.
The processing steps are detailed in the Supporting Documentation.
To ensure consistency of the final product, total population numbers were compared, at each processing step, with the official 2021/2022 Census totals. As a result, the final output file is consistent with the Census total population for the UK in 2021.
